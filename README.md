# Number Guessing Game in C

## Overview

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in C. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess the number. The game provides feedback on how close the guess is and tracks the number of attempts until the correct guess is made.

## Features

- The machine randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
- The player inputs their guess.
- The program provides hints if the guess is within 5 of the actual number, indicating whether the guess is higher or lower.
- At the end of the game, the total number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly is displayed.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of how to compile and run C programs.

## How to Compile and Run the Game
